# Introduction

All you need to know to pass AP Physics 1.

## Collegeboard Description

* Develop a deep understanding of foundational principles of physics in classical mechanics and modern physics by applying these principles to complex physical situations that combine multiple aspects of physics rather than present concepts in isolation

* Discuss, confer, and debate with classmates to explain a physical phenomenon investigated in class

* Design and conduct inquiry-based laboratory investigations to solve problems through first-hand observations, data collection, analysis and interpretation
