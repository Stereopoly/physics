# Introduction

All you need to know to pass AP Physics 1.

## Collegeboard Description

* Develop a deep understanding of foundational principles of physics in classical mechanics and modern physics by applying these principles to complex physical situations that combine multiple aspects of physics rather than present concepts in isolation

* Discuss, confer, and debate with classmates to explain a physical phenomenon investigated in class

* Design and conduct inquiry-based laboratory investigations to solve problems through first-hand observations, data collection, analysis and interpretation

# Classical Mechanics

## Kinematics

## Newton's Laws

```plaintext
F = m*a

## Electric Forces and Fields

```plaintext
1C = 1.6*10^-19
```

The electric force between two charged particles obeys a law very similar to that describing the gravitational force betwen two masses.

```plaintext
Coulomb's Law: F = kq1*q2 / r^2
k = 9*10^9
```

<aside class="notice">
Coulomb's Law: F = kq1q2 / r^2, where k = 9E10^9
</aside>

This is Coulomb's law. A negative F is an attraction between the charges and a positive F is a repulsion.

The presence of a charge creates an electric field. Another charge placed in the field will experience a force due to the field.

```plaintext
E = F / q
```

<aside class="notice">
Electric field vector E equals Force on q / test charge q
</aside>

A positive source charge has vectors pointing away from it. A negative source charge has vectors pointing towards it.

The strength of an electric field is determind by the density of the field lines.

```plaintext
F = q*E
```
The force generated on a charge in an electric field is given by F = qE.

```plaintext
Ue = qV
```

<aside class="notice">
The potential energy of an electric field is equal to the charge (q) times the potential difference (V).
</aside>

There are 3 methods of electrification:
* Friction - rubbing i.e. fur against a rod 
* Contact - touching another object
* Induction - rearrangement of electrons in the presence of a charged object

<aside class="warning">
Don't confuse electric potential with electric potential energy!
</aside>

```plaintext
V = kQ / r
```

Electric potential is the work needed to move a unit positive charge into an electric field without any acceleration. It is usually written with a V (volts).
